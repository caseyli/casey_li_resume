			Dear Shopify,	
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Less than a year has passed and so much has changed.	
		</p>
		 
		<p>
			It was July 13th of last year that I actually applied to a Shopify Job Posting.
			Everything seemed to go well until I hit a technical interview that proved I just wasn’t qualified enough.
			I had a small fear that all the energy and passion I had built up might have been doused by this news.
			Luckily, it did not.						
		</p>

		<p>
			The natural question for an employer looking at a candidate who’s applied before is – what has changed since you
			last applied? Well I can honestly say a lot.	
		</p>
		
		<p>
			2 weeks after I lost the position at Shopify, I got a call from a small startup called Teldio looking for a
			Rails developer. Looking to improve on this new found love of mine, I naturally jumped at the opportunity.
			The decision to join the Teldio team proved to be one of the best career decisions I’ve made.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Going to Teldio gave me a good context change where I could hone my Rails skills in a full-time environment.
			The passion that had initially sparked in learning Rails continued on.
			During my time at Teldio, I also took on several personal Rails projects. Things I would learn at work I’d apply at home and vice-versa.
			Not only that, shortly after I started, I was appointed to a Product Owner role. It was a real eye-opener for me on many fronts.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			So what has changed? When I originally applied, I was new to the Rails world and disconnected from the forward-thinking
			software community. Today, on top of a wealth of real-world Rails experience including professional, personal, and Shopify apps,
			I have also joined two Ottawa Meetup communities (Agile Ottawa and Ottawa Ruby), gained good startup experience at Teldio, and more.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Shopify has always been the dream place to work for me. Just as before, the more I learn and hear about Shopify,
			the more I realize it’s where I need to be.	
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I didn’t get the job last year, but that didn’t stop me from working hard to achieve my goal. Today, I’m confident that
			I have something to offer Shopify.	
		</p>

		<p>
			Please take some time to browse my online application as I feel it best showcases my work. The opportunity for an interview
			would be amazing. I’d be willing to come in at anytime.
		</p>

		<p>
			I thank you so much for your time and consideration and hope to hear from you soon.	
		</p>
