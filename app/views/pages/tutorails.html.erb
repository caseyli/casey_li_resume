			Hi everybody, my name is Casey Li and I'm a web developer based out of Ottawa. I studied software engineering at UOttawa
			from 2001-2006. I actually started out doing Java programming, but slowly moved into web development with JSP and .Net.
			However, it wasn't until I jumped into Ruby on Rails that my web development passion really took off. Seriously - Ruby
			on Rails was the first programming framework I've dealt with that didn't hinder my creativity. Since then, I started
			up a web design company (shameless plug, <%= link_to "http://www.bitesite.ca", "http://www.bitesite.ca" %>) and have
			been loving it ever since. I'm passionate about Rails, but I'm also passionate about teaching. So that's why I'm running
			this free course.
